# Chat-bot README

## Getting Started

To use this Chat bot, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

3. **Start the application**: Once the dependencies are installed, start the application by running `npm start` in your terminal.

4. **Authorization**: Upon starting the application, you will be needing to authorize yourself by scanning the QR code displayed in the terminal. To do this, follow these steps:

    - Open your WhatsApp mobile app.
    - Go to Settings.
    - Tap on the QR code icon.
    - Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal.

    This is necessary to authenticate and use the chat functionality.

5. **Start chatting**: Once authorized, if someone sends you the message "Hello", you will see the response in both the chat interface and the terminal.
